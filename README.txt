Welcome to calculator_val project!

This is a simple calculator that performes a few basic operations. 
Every operation will take as an input 2 arguments.
The operations available are 'sum', 'subtraction' and 'nroot'.

sum : returns the sum of the 2 input floats.

subtraction: returns the difference of the 2 input floats.

nroot: takes a float base and a float root as an input an retuturns the n_th root of the base.


Don't worry too much about this description, all the information you need will be asked to you in the prompt line while using the package. To get started just run the __init__.py file. A nice menu GUI will guide you through the use of the calculator and ask you directly which operations you want to perform and so on. 
If you are an avanced user you can also install this package form pip under the name calculator_val. This code is protected by MIT Licence which gives you freedom to reuse it. Please check the License file for more information.
